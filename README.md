Ideas
=====
* Have a storm topology doing the stock analysis and put everything out into a public KV-store (e.g. http://openkeyval.org/). 
That way we can have a simple single-page app in JavaScript that publishes the info. That way the app is always up; 
running the topology just reshuffles the store.
